Josh Snyder: One sec. Make sure nothing
Sean Smith: Pull it
Josh Snyder: gets
Sean Smith: up as well.
Josh Snyder: translation.
Joe Vetoe: Yes. So, I'll uh I'll just share this part here. Okay. So, yeah. Um Okay. So, we have this. So, just going through this. Uh I just kind of want to go through step by step. So the you know the proposal is one. So for the job scheduling and assigning that part
Sean Smith: That's something that
Joe Vetoe: uh
Sean Smith: we would do like before it goes into that like that. uh we just schedule who's going to be going out onto the site and then um as we're like opening up the job folder and things like that, putting it onto our uh status support, that's when we would make or input the uh elements of the uh forms in the app to like autofill with like the job number and things like that. So,
Joe Vetoe: And is that something um just so I understand is this I know you guys have this process with air table and uh you know Google calendars if if we build out the solution um is It is it best to do you guys want to streamline that process?
 
 
00:01:30
 
Joe Vetoe: I know we talked maybe a little bit about
Sean Smith: you
Joe Vetoe: this
Sean Smith: know,
Joe Vetoe: the
Sean Smith: we've
Joe Vetoe: last
Sean Smith: tried
Joe Vetoe: time
Sean Smith: to do that before
Joe Vetoe: we
Sean Smith: with
Joe Vetoe: talked
Sean Smith: Zapier and because everything is on the cloud. It just never works 100% of the time. It works like 75% of the time and then it just wastes time because we don't know which time it's working and which time it's not working. um like between all the different cloud-based services like so between box and air tableable and Google we tried with Zapier to make them to make the process automated and it's never
Joe Vetoe: Sure.
Sean Smith: worked and I don't know if it's because like it misses itself when it's like transferring over or whatever. Um but um I think right now what we have in mind is we get a project number and then boom you go. So yeah, our our people can find it via project number um and so if they put in a project number then you would be able to see it or if there was an Excel table that had the project number and you know every like every evening we uploaded you know an Excel sheet of all the new projects that were open that day.
 
 
00:02:43
 
Sean Smith: Then people would be able to go into this app and put in a project number and then they would see the files associated with that project number which would be blank files, right?
Joe Vetoe: Okay. Uh so if but if if if we're building out you know basically a custom solution uh would having this all this process in a in a portal be best right so like you don't have to go to Excel like to to start the process everything is done from a from the
Sean Smith: Well, if
Joe Vetoe: portal
Sean Smith: you
Joe Vetoe: that
Sean Smith: could get
Joe Vetoe: we
Sean Smith: it out
Joe Vetoe: can
Sean Smith: of Air Table, then we wouldn't have to do anything. So, yes. So, it's all in Air
Joe Vetoe: Okay.
Sean Smith: Table then for that. If that's what you're talking about, you could get it straight from Air Table on a daily basis. Really easy. What project was number was opened on which day and who's assigned to it? But
Joe Vetoe: Okay.
 
 
00:03:36
 
Sean Smith: yeah,
Joe Vetoe: Would you prefer I guess maybe I'm not being clear. Would you prefer to like take Air Table out of the equation and do everything from one centralized location?
Sean Smith: Air Table works right now and we are not willing to
Joe Vetoe: Okay.
Sean Smith: f with Air Table because we have
Joe Vetoe: Okay.
Sean Smith: gone through so many we have gone through so many systems that just were horrible and effed with everything. So no, we do not want to move off of Air Table because Air Table
Joe Vetoe: Okay.
Sean Smith: we can control. We don't have to ask anyone else to change it and it's user friendly. Yeah, it definitely helps throughout the life of the project. Let's like organize throughout. And right now you're only working on um on inspections and we do a thousand different types of jobs. Yeah.
Joe Vetoe: Okay. Um All right.
Josh Snyder: Then we
Joe Vetoe: So
Josh Snyder: would
Joe Vetoe: that's
Josh Snyder: use
Joe Vetoe: good
Josh Snyder: air
Joe Vetoe: to
 
 
00:04:26
 
Josh Snyder: table as the data source then Joe I guess right and
Joe Vetoe: Right.
Josh Snyder: pull.
Sean Smith: Yes.
Joe Vetoe: Yeah.
Josh Snyder: Okay.
Joe Vetoe: Okay. Uh good to know. And then uh this is done obviously um on
Sean Smith: Yeah.
Joe Vetoe: location
Sean Smith: So this is how we do it now. This flowchart is how we do it now. So like prepares for jobs. So like this is where uh what do you have highlighted? That's where the inspector would be collecting their bulk forms, any equipment that they would need. Say if um we're doing a full hazmat, then it would be the grabbing the XRF gun. um getting our HMI inventory forms. Um and then just, you know, seeing like where where they're going, like uh punching in, how far away it is, things like that.
Joe Vetoe: Okay. And then so when it says paperwork, is that
Sean Smith: Those
Joe Vetoe: is
Sean Smith: are all
Joe Vetoe: it
Sean Smith: the forms.
Joe Vetoe: actual like it's just it's electronic, right?
 
 
00:05:18
 
Joe Vetoe: It's not, you know, they're not taking
Sean Smith: No, we do pen and paper. We're asking you to make
Joe Vetoe: Okay.
Sean Smith: our paper forms electronic.
Joe Vetoe: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I just Okay. I just want to make sure. Um, yep. Okay, perfect. And then got that and feeds. Okay. Sorry, I'm just going through just making sure that I um understand the process. So then once it gets so here it can either go depending on what they find, right? It either goes full hazmat
Sean Smith: Well,
Joe Vetoe: or
Sean Smith: that's
Joe Vetoe: uh
Sean Smith: like
Joe Vetoe: asbestous
Sean Smith: depending
Joe Vetoe: only,
Sean Smith: on what
Joe Vetoe: right?
Sean Smith: type of job it is. So, if it's a asbesus only because like just preparing for the job doesn't matter what it is. But, uh, for asbesus only, that's just the bulk form pretty much. And then the general service log full hazmat is when you get into your HMI and then the um XRF table or the lead.
 
 
00:06:12
 
Sean Smith: So
Joe Vetoe: Got
Sean Smith: did
Joe Vetoe: you.
Sean Smith: you say which forms and which way? Yeah.
Joe Vetoe: Yeah.
Sean Smith: So
Joe Vetoe: So,
Sean Smith: then
Joe Vetoe: it's Yeah. B forms and then Okay. And then these are the tables and the forms. Okay. And then um and so this part here
Sean Smith: that's once we send all those samples out. Uh there's a depending on what turnaround time we got to wait until we get the results back and then uh once we see and interpret the results then we give uh what we refer to as like variables but we just let the client know like hey either everything came back negative or these are the things that came back positive for speesus and then um we take that data and input it to write our reports.
Joe Vetoe: Okay. Uh,
Sean Smith: And so
Joe Vetoe: all right.
Sean Smith: what type of report is dependent on what job it is. So like uh the full hazmat report is the best one if uh you were going to use one um to model these forms after.
 
 
00:07:22
 
Sean Smith: But I like right now say if it's a asbestous only survey that we did and everything came back negative then we can do the asbesus only non detect or if you know spot survey things like Yeah.
Joe Vetoe: Okay, perfect. Okay. And reports written, approved, and sent. Okay. And then uh so the what's the what's I guess what's ideal here for this? Um how is it sent to the
Sean Smith: We get a PDF
Joe Vetoe: how how do you
Sean Smith: version.
Joe Vetoe: you okay so um and then it's manually the lab analyzes it okay related results client is formed to results okay and then the report is written okay I meant I didn't mean to go here and then I guess I wasn't
Sean Smith: That's
Joe Vetoe: really
Sean Smith: just
Joe Vetoe: sure
Sean Smith: the key.
Joe Vetoe: about this this bottom part. Okay.
Sean Smith: That's the
Joe Vetoe: Gotcha.
Sean Smith: key.
Joe Vetoe: Okay.
Sean Smith: Yeah. I didn't make
Joe Vetoe: Yep.
Sean Smith: like a full title,
 
 
00:08:21
 
Joe Vetoe: So the
Sean Smith: but
Joe Vetoe: form
Sean Smith: like
Joe Vetoe: associated.
Sean Smith: in the gray, that's like where we're at. In the orange, that's the forms associated. And then there are notes attached to what form.
Joe Vetoe: Gotcha. Okay. All right.
Sean Smith: So everything in the orange are things that we would like in the app. Yeah, those are the forms. Sorry.
Joe Vetoe: Okay. And
Sean Smith: Just
Joe Vetoe: so
Sean Smith: Yeah,
Joe Vetoe: we built those out. Okay. Um, yeah. So, I mean, this is is definitely I have no doubt that we we can build this this flow out for you and and and make it how you need it. Um my question is like ideally you know as far as the data collection goes you know I understand and we we can figure out how to you know set up those forms and collect that data and get that um the the part after the you know the data is collected and and you have it and you send it here is it ideally what what would these two steps B is it that um you know you
 
 
00:09:35
 
Sean Smith: So
Joe Vetoe: have
Sean Smith: ultimately it would be to get the information autopop populated into the reports. That was one of the things like u that uh Josh and I think back the other rep um he mentioned that once we get data back it would be able to fill out reports um and kind of at least start them off like rather than taking all the information from you know what came back positive and then we in a word document or an an excel document make a table of like this is the material the location, quantity, what percentage of asbesus it is, or if it came back not detected.
Josh Snyder: Yes.
Sean Smith: And so that would be able to be autopop populated. It would just have to since we get a PDF version. It would might be difficult um to uh unless like there's an ability to scan, but I think also we we can answer a series of questions from your from the app that that put certain things into a report.
Josh Snyder: correct.
Sean Smith: Right
Josh Snyder: So
 
 
00:10:48
 
Sean Smith: now those things are happening manually. Our our tech is answering questions manually. If this then this section goes in. If that then this section goes in. You got and then they're also manually typing out everything that they're handwriting into these forms. But all of that is in your app. So we want that to go into the report. I'm not concerned with the lab results going into the report as much as I'm concerned with our handwritten forms all of that information getting into a report. I mean, yes, obviously, we're going to look at it and make sure that it's okay, but it there's totally a way where this can be easily automated, and right now it's
Joe Vetoe: Right.
Sean Smith: not. Right now, everything is handwritten in the field. Yeah. And then it has to be retyped, and then somebody has to go through the mental exercises a second time to put it into the report. So, when they're in the field, they could be answering all these questions. if this, then that, if this, then that, if this, then that, and then entering in all their findings and all the different types of materials and what the numbers were.
 
 
00:11:48
 
Sean Smith: And then the report should should be 75% done. Then we
Joe Vetoe: Yeah.
Sean Smith: get the results back from the client. And usually those don't even have to be retyped. Sometimes those can even just go as an appendix. And we we answer a question that says, "Were they hot or not? Which ones? What does that mean?" So like one paragraph could be written and the report's done. Because if everything that happened in the field could be automated to put into the report, all
Josh Snyder: Yeah.
Sean Smith: we'd have to do is write like one paragraph
Joe Vetoe: Yep.
Josh Snyder: Yeah. Joe,
Sean Smith: of like
Josh Snyder: so
Sean Smith: findings
Josh Snyder: for
Sean Smith: and recommendations.
Josh Snyder: Joe, for your benefit, I do have sample reports from RPF that they sent us quite a while ago when we first started this process um thinking maybe I forbuilder would solve the issue.
Sean Smith: Can you pause this
Joe Vetoe: Mhm.
Josh Snyder: So
Sean Smith: for
Josh Snyder: I
 
 
00:12:35
 
Sean Smith: me?
Josh Snyder: can pass those to you um Joe. And then also, you know, basically we're just looking to replicate report customization that's in
Joe Vetoe: Right.
Josh Snyder: legacy formula into here into the customize app. Um,
Joe Vetoe: Okay.
Josh Snyder: so I'll send you those reports.
Joe Vetoe: Yep. Okay. Yeah, that's this is all perfect. So, um I just wanted to make sure we were all on the same page. I mean, this is definitely something that um we can do with our with our code generation um and and build this custom solution for you. Um, so I don't have any I get I mean for me it was just making sure I understood the the flow which I which I do and and what you know and what was needed and where I form was kind of getting you most of the way there but not completely and how we can we can solve the rest of it. So,
Sean Smith: No, I set
Joe Vetoe: uh,
Sean Smith: it up like all on one slide just uh I was thinking whether to do like Well, because they asked us they said like multiple
 
 
00:13:39
 
Joe Vetoe: yeah. Yeah,
Sean Smith: times
Joe Vetoe: this
Sean Smith: they
Joe Vetoe: is
Sean Smith: wanted
Joe Vetoe: perfect.
Sean Smith: to know our whole process.
Joe Vetoe: Yep.
Sean Smith: So,
Joe Vetoe: Yeah, this is perfect. So, I Yeah, like I said, I just wanted to make sure uh, you know, I wasn't misinterpreting and then just those kind of follow-up questions about, you know, what happens afterwards. So, um, yeah, that's perfect. So, like I said, um you know, as far as our uh our AI team goes, like definitely feel confident and that we can build out this solution the way that you need to. Uh Josh, I don't know um if you know if you want to talk about next steps and what we do
Josh Snyder: Yes. Um I'm
Joe Vetoe: um
Josh Snyder: actually
Joe Vetoe: next, but
Josh Snyder: I'm
Joe Vetoe: yeah.
Josh Snyder: forwarding you some a zip from Schwan and a couple of PDFs from Briana. Um so I just did that. Um so you have those in your inbox.
 
 
00:14:31
 
Josh Snyder: Um yeah. So, thanks for the clarification. This helps. So, we're actually able to take something like the table that you built here, the flowchart, and actually transcripts from this conversation um and previous conversations, and plug them into Joe and his team's AI tool to actually start building this. The first process of that uh is a consulting arrangement where for um a $3,000 fee, we actually build this out in a wireframe way so that you can see what it's going to look like before it actually gets into the part where it's an actual piece of software. And so that way we can totally be on the same page that we've taken all that you've provided us, we've spun it into the AI engine to then um basically make a visual kind of detailed requirements type document um that we can show you. So once we get through that process, it
Sean Smith: Let's
Josh Snyder: does a couple of things. One, what I just said, it makes a visual for you uh to know that we're all on the same page of how the software is going to look on our side.
 
 
00:15:34
 
Josh Snyder: What it also does is gives us the level of effort
Sean Smith: go.
Josh Snyder: um as far as total build for the software itself and what that price tag is going to be the investment to you. Um so we feel like that's the most efficient way and most transparent way to make sure that what we're building for you is going to um going to align with your vision. Um so that would be the kind of the next step in the process. I can send you a quote uh for the three grand. And once that's signed, we just go off and run and we start building the wireframes for you.
Joe Vetoe: Yeah. And that's usually,
Sean Smith: It's
Joe Vetoe: you know,
Sean Smith: coming.
Joe Vetoe: probably about a 3 to four week process.
Josh Snyder: Correct. Yeah.
Joe Vetoe: And it'll be collaborative. So it won't be um, you know, we won't go away for four weeks and then come back and say, is this good? Right. So through that process, there'll be updates to make sure like as we're putting these screens together or these prototypes together that you guys are seeing them as as we're going along.
 
 
00:16:32
 
Joe Vetoe: Uh, we'll, you know, send them so that you guys can see it.
Josh Snyder: Yeah.
Joe Vetoe: Uh,
Josh Snyder: So once
Joe Vetoe: and then at
Josh Snyder: Joe sends out um updates on on what's going on with the build process for the wireframing
Sean Smith: So, I thought the reason why, because you already told me the $3,000 thing last time, I thought the reason for Sean drawing this out was so that your team could tell us like how much it would cost to make after the $3,000. And then if you could go over again how much it would cost for all of our staff to like actually use once it is built out. It's like I thought today we were going to find out how much it was going to cost beyond the $3,000.
Josh Snyder: Yeah. So, let me revisit a couple things there. Uh, Tanya, one is this way of what we're building for you um is not a user model. So, you can have whatever users you want in this platform um in this custom build that we're making for you.
 
 
00:17:29
 
Josh Snyder: So, you don't have to
Sean Smith: So,
Josh Snyder: worry
Sean Smith: how much does it cost then to use after you build it out?
Josh Snyder: uh that like I said comes from the $3,000 consulting fee to build it out for you in a wireframe way. Then we'll know at the end of that process um the total cost for the build.
Sean Smith: So once we build it, we could use it forever cuz it's ours.
Josh Snyder: Yeah. So, uh good point. So uh it is yours and not only that the way we're building now with AI codegen, not only do we build it via AI codegen, but we also build into it a maintenance engine to it. So that way we're eliminating for you the notion of what's called technical debt. So three, four, five years down the road, you're not going to have to revisit a human coded on top of human coded mess of of a piece of software. It actually has a maintenance engine into it. So like uh iOS updates or you know other operating system updates that you're using that's all taken into account security updates that's all done via an AI engine.
 
 
00:18:29
 
Josh Snyder: And so yes your piece of software that you own will now uh be u maintained over time.
Sean Smith: and there's no annual maintenance cost
Josh Snyder: No
Sean Smith: to
Josh Snyder: there
Sean Smith: you guys.
Josh Snyder: yeah there is an annual
Sean Smith: That's what
Josh Snyder: m
Sean Smith: I'm asking. How much will it cost after? So, we do the $3,000. Then we you then you guys tell us how many thousands of dollars of it cost and then how much does it use cost for us to use
Josh Snyder: Right? That's all determined via the 3000 like uh so it will be based on basically how much software we have to build for you and thus how much uh it's going to cost us to host and things like that um and provide all that for you in the cloud. And then I'll be very transparent with what that fee is at the end of that process.
Sean Smith: Okay. Well, you can send us the paperwork then. That's fine.
Josh Snyder: Okay, I appreciate that. Um, uh, any other questions are swimming around your head as far as that aspect of it?
Sean Smith: Were you looking something up? Uh, no. I was just looking at my notes from the last meeting we had. as far as further questions, I think we just we have to discuss generally like how we want to proceed this and then So if you send that will look it over and then we will be in touch. I thank you.
Josh Snyder: Yeah, appreciate it. Let me know if any questions come up after we kick off this meeting and yeah I'll get that too soon as I can.
Sean Smith: Thank you. Okay, sounds good. Thank you.
Josh Snyder: but,
Joe Vetoe: Thank
