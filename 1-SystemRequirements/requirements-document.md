# Enterprise Application Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the development of an enterprise application for job scheduling, assignment, and data collection to streamline workflow processes currently managed through Airtable and paper forms.

## 2. Project Overview

The application will serve as a centralized portal that integrates with the existing Airtable system while digitizing the current pen-and-paper data collection forms used during inspections. The solution aims to automate report generation, reducing manual data entry and report creation time.

## 3. Authentication Requirements

### 3.1 Single Sign-On (SSO)
- **SSO Integration**: Implement single sign-on capabilities using both Google and Microsoft authentication services.
- **User Authentication Flow**: Users should be able to sign in seamlessly using their existing Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 credentials.
- **Session Management**: Implement secure session handling with appropriate timeout mechanisms.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Support MFA where available through the SSO providers.

### 3.2 User Management
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Define and implement user roles with appropriate permissions.
- **User Provisioning**: Integrate with Google/Microsoft directory services for automatic user provisioning and deprovisioning.
- **Profile Management**: Allow users to view and update their profile information.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Airtable Integration
- **Data Source Integration**: Use Airtable as the primary data source for the application.
- **Bi-directional Sync**: Implement real-time synchronization between the application and Airtable.
- **Data Mapping**: Map Airtable fields to application entities maintaining data integrity.

### 4.2 Job Scheduling and Assignment
- **Calendar Integration**: Integrate with Google Calendar for job scheduling.
- **Assignment Management**: Provide interface for assigning staff to jobs.
- **Schedule Visualization**: Display daily, weekly, and monthly job schedules.
- **Notification System**: Implement notifications for new assignments and schedule changes.

### 4.3 Digital Forms
- **Form Digitization**: Convert all existing paper forms into digital formats.
- **Dynamic Form Generation**: Generate appropriate forms based on job type (e.g., asbestos only, full hazmat).
- **Offline Capability**: Allow forms to be filled out in the field, even without internet connectivity.
- **Photo/Document Attachment**: Enable attachment of photos and documents to form submissions.
- **Data Validation**: Implement field-level validation to ensure data integrity.

### 4.4 Report Generation
- **Automated Report Creation**: Auto-populate reports with data collected from digital forms.
- **PDF Generation**: Generate finalized reports in PDF format.
- **Report Templates**: Support multiple report templates based on job type.
- **Report Approval Workflow**: Implement review and approval process for generated reports.
- **Report Storage and Retrieval**: Store and organize generated reports for easy retrieval.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Performance
- **Response Time**: The application should respond to user interactions within 2 seconds.
- **Concurrent Users**: Support at least 50 concurrent users without degradation in performance.
- **Form Submission**: Digital form submissions should process within 5 seconds.

### 5.2 Security
- **Data Encryption**: Implement encryption for data in transit and at rest.
- **Access Controls**: Enforce principle of least privilege for all system functions.
- **Audit Logging**: Maintain comprehensive logs of all system activities.
- **Compliance**: Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations.

### 5.3 Usability
- **Intuitive Interface**: Design an intuitive, user-friendly interface requiring minimal training.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure the application functions well on mobile devices for field use.
- **Accessibility**: Comply with WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.

### 5.4 Reliability
- **Availability**: The system should maintain 99.9% uptime during business hours.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Implement automated backup procedures and disaster recovery plans.
- **Error Handling**: Provide clear error messages and recovery paths for common issues.

## 6. Technical Requirements

### 6.1 Architecture
- **Hosting**: Define appropriate hosting solution based on final application complexity.
- **Integration Architecture**: Design API-based integration with Airtable and other systems.
- **Scalability**: Implement architecture that can scale with increasing users and data volume.

### 6.2 Maintenance
- **Maintenance Engine**: Incorporate the built-in maintenance engine mentioned in the meeting.
- **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive technical and user documentation.
- **Code Quality**: Ensure high-quality, maintainable code generated with AI assistance.

## 7. Deliverables

### 7.1 Development Process
- **Wireframes**: Initial wireframes depicting application design and functionality.
- **Development Updates**: Regular updates on development progress.
- **Collaborative Development**: Opportunities for adjustment and feedback during development.

### 7.2 Final Deliverables
- **Completed Application**: Fully functional application meeting all requirements.
- **Source Code**: Complete source code owned by the client.
- **Documentation**: User manuals and technical documentation.
- **Training Materials**: Materials for training staff on using the new application.

## 8. Project Timeline and Cost

### 8.1 Timeline
- **Wireframe Development**: To be determined after initial consultation.
- **Development Phase**: To be determined after wireframe approval.
- **Testing and Deployment**: To be determined after development planning.

### 8.2 Cost Structure
- **Initial Consulting Fee**: $3,000 for wireframe development.
- **Final Development Cost**: To be determined based on wireframe complexity and finalized requirements.
- **Ownership Model**: One-time payment, with client owning the final application.
- **Maintenance**: No ongoing annual maintenance costs.

## 9. Assumptions and Constraints

### 9.1 Assumptions
- Airtable will continue to be the primary data storage solution.
- Users have access to Google or Microsoft accounts for SSO functionality.
- Internet connectivity is available for most, but not all, field operations.

### 9.2 Constraints
- The application must integrate with existing Airtable setup without requiring significant changes.
- The system must be intuitive enough for users familiar with Airtable's interface.
- Development must stay within budget parameters to be established after wireframing.
